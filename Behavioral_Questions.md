## Tell me about yourself
My name is Yifan Wu and I'm a Machine Learning specialist and AI enthusiast. The the past 5 years, I was focusing on cultivating my skills in machine learning, cloud solutions, and big data analysis.

I went to grad school at Georgetown University in Master of Science in Data Science for two years to build a solid academic background. At my recent role with BDO Digital, I’m using classical ML and Microsoft Azure to access risk in the insurance industry and translating my modeling results to profitable insight and share with business stakeholders.
	
Unlike my current role at BDO, which is advisory and consulting, my previous job is heavily product oriented. I was a Computer vision developer and Data Scientist at a company that uses ML to analyze drone imageries. I've worked with petabytes of unstructured imagery data, researched and implemented different CNN algorithms, prototyped and maintained ML pipelines in AWS. I'm also an active member of several largest online machine learning community there is because I think it's important to keep track of the latest technologies there is in the field of ML.

## Tell me about a project at BDO
- **Situation:** At BDO Digital, I led a significant project for the Cooperative of American Physicians, a top 5 client of BDO. The objective was to overhaul their medical insurance underwriting process through the application of AI, necessitating a comprehensive exploration of AI's role in healthcare, especially in medical insurance.
- **Task:**  My responsibility was to develop one or more AI models capable of not only assigning an overall risk score to each physician but also providing insights into how various risk indicators (such as physician background, work patterns, patient behavior) influenced their overall risk score. This approach aimed to offer a multi-dimensional perspective on the reasoning behind each risk assessment, requiring sophisticated model development and statistical analysis. Additionally, seamless integration of the AI model with the client's existing systems was imperative.
- **Action:**  The process began with extensive market research and review of academic literature on AI applications within medical insurance. Subsequently, I acquired a substantial volume of public Medicare data on physicians to augment our client's dataset. This data was meticulously loaded into an Azure SQL database, with careful attention to data types and formatting to facilitate efficient querying.  
I opted for a random forest model, a tree-based classification approach, which was deployed on Azure ML Studio using Python SDK, Docker, and MLFlow to ensure a streamlined CI/CD process. Given the data storage in both Oracle and Azure SQL databases, I crafted complex SQL algorithms for data cleaning, wrangling, and feature engineering, preparing the data for model training and usage.
- **Result:**  The integration of data into the Azure SQL database significantly reduced errors and simplified query processes. The fine-tuned Random Forest model I developed demonstrated high accuracy in predicting physician medical malpractice risk, outperforming traditional manual assessment methods.

## Biggest challenge at BDO
- **Situation**: In the same project for the Cooperative of American Physicians, one of the key tasks was to enrich the client's on-premise database with public data. The challenge was that the database was hosted on-premise/a.k.a a local machine to cut cost, while our entire pipeline was set up in Azure, which is a cloud-based environment.
- **Task**: My main challenge was to ensure seamless data flow between the on-premise database and our cloud-based Azure pipeline. This was crucial for the model to access and process the data efficiently.
- **Action**: I initially tried to establish a direct connection between the Azure cloud environment and the on-premise database. However, this approach faced several hurdles, mainly due to network compatibility and security issues. After extensive research and troubleshooting, which involved reading numerous blog posts and technical documents, I ended up building a secure virtual network and place the Docker container, which ran the model, under this network. I then rerouted all traffic to the model endpoint through this virtual network. This process was complex and required me to escalate the issue to Microsoft's official dev support team and the network admin on client's side, because I encountered limitations due to restricted network setting permissions. It was crucial for me to break down the technical details in a way that was easy to grasp and to ensure they were comfortable with the approach, especially since it involved keeping their data on-premise to cut costs.
- **Result**: After nearly two weeks of hard effort and collaboration with Microsoft's support team, the issue was successfully resolved. This solution not only ensured the secure and efficient flow of data between the on-premise database and the cloud environment but also enhanced the overall reliability of our data pipeline. 
It was all about keeping everyone on the same page. I made sure to keep the client looped in with regular updates - kind of like translating tech-speak into everyday language. And when things got really technical, I wasn't shy about pulling in some extra brainpower. We had a great team at BDO, and reaching out to Microsoft's support team was a game-changer, too. It's amazing how much you can achieve when you combine a bit of teamwork with open and honest communication.

## Why do you want to leave your job?
Firstly, I greatly value the experiences I've had in my current role, and I've learned a lot from the challenges presented.
	
The allocated project budget does not match the amount of work it requires to deliver a satisfying solution. This comes from the underestimation of the workload needed for developing full-scale ML solutions and it has really taken a tole on my work-life balance. 
Moreover, due to the short project timelines, our solutions tend to focus on the short term. However Managing the performance of ML pipelines and and data drift is a long-term progress it is just simply not feasible in the current setting. While I appreciate opportunities for growth, the rapid pace without adequate time for skill acquisition has been challenging.

I ready for a fresh challenge.

## What is your biggest achievement?
My greatest achievement was in my previous role where I built a prototype pipeline that automatically gather data and train model in iterative fashion. It was achieved by packaging python code inside various docker containers, plugging the containers into AWS Sagemaker tasks, and orchestrating different components by using AWS step function. This frees up machine learning team from day-to-day cumbersome work, which takes the majority of their time, and to work on more advanced research-oriented work without loosing visibility and control of the model training process. And the result of this is improved team productivity and level of skill set across the whole machine learning team.

## What's your ideal work environment?
My ideal work environment is positive and has a good work-life balance, is one where everyone in the team supports each other and seeks to continually grow and improve, and where I would get to use my data science skill to help solve real life business problem.
