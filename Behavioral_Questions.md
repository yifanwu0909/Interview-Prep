## Tell me about yourself
My name is Yifan Wu and I'm a Machine Learning specialist and AI enthusiast. The the past 5 years, I was focusing on cultivating my skills in machine learning, cloud solutions, and big data analysis.

I went to grad school at Georgetown University in Master of Science in Data Science for two years to build a solid academic background. At my recent role with BDO Digital, I’m using classical ML and Microsoft Azure to access risk in the insurance industry and translating my modeling results to profitable insight and share with business stakeholders.
	
Unlike my current role at BDO, which is advisory and consulting, my previous job is heavily product oriented. I was a Computer vision developer and Data Scientist at a company that uses ML to analyze drone imageries. I've worked with petabytes of unstructured imagery data, researched and implemented different CNN algorithms, prototyped and maintained ML pipelines in AWS. I'm also an active member of several largest online machine learning community there is because I think it's important to keep track of the latest technologies there is in the field of ML.

## Tell me about a project at BDO
- **Situation:** At BDO Digital, I led a significant project for the Cooperative of American Physicians, a top 5 client of BDO. The objective was to overhaul their medical insurance underwriting process through the application of AI, necessitating a comprehensive exploration of AI's role in healthcare, especially in medical insurance.
- **Task:**  My responsibility was to develop one or more AI models capable of not only assigning an overall risk score to each physician but also providing insights into how various risk indicators (such as physician background, work patterns, patient behavior) influenced their overall risk score. This approach aimed to offer a multi-dimensional perspective on the reasoning behind each risk assessment, requiring sophisticated model development and statistical analysis. Additionally, seamless integration of the AI model with the client's existing systems was imperative.
- **Action:**  The process began with extensive market research and review of academic literature on AI applications within medical insurance. Subsequently, I acquired a substantial volume of public Medicare data on physicians to augment our client's dataset. This data was meticulously loaded into an Azure SQL database, with careful attention to data types and formatting to facilitate efficient querying.  
I opted for a random forest model, a tree-based classification approach, which was deployed on Azure ML Studio using Python SDK, Docker, and MLFlow to ensure a streamlined CI/CD process. Given the data storage in both Oracle and Azure SQL databases, I crafted complex SQL algorithms for data cleaning, wrangling, and feature engineering, preparing the data for model training and usage.
- **Result:**  The integration of data into the Azure SQL database significantly reduced errors and simplified query processes. The fine-tuned Random Forest model I developed demonstrated high accuracy in predicting physician medical malpractice risk, outperforming traditional manual assessment methods.

## Biggest challenge at BDO
- **Situation**: In the same project for the Cooperative of American Physicians, one of the key tasks was to enrich the client's on-premise database with public data. The challenge was that the database was hosted on-premise/a.k.a a local machine to cut cost, while our entire pipeline was set up in Azure, which is a cloud-based environment.
- **Task**: My main challenge was to ensure seamless data flow between the on-premise database and our cloud-based Azure pipeline. This was crucial for the model to access and process the data efficiently.
- **Action**: I initially tried to establish a direct connection between the Azure cloud environment and the on-premise database. However, this approach faced several hurdles, mainly due to network compatibility and security issues. After extensive research and troubleshooting, which involved reading numerous blog posts and technical documents, I ended up building a secure virtual network and place the Docker container, which ran the model, under this network. I then rerouted all traffic to the model endpoint through this virtual network. This process was complex and required me to escalate the issue to Microsoft's official dev support team and the network admin on client's side, because I encountered limitations due to restricted network setting permissions. It was crucial for me to break down the technical details in a way that was easy to grasp and to ensure they were comfortable with the approach, especially since it involved keeping their data on-premise to cut costs.
- **Result**: After nearly two weeks of hard effort and collaboration with Microsoft's support team, the issue was successfully resolved. This solution not only ensured the secure and efficient flow of data between the on-premise database and the cloud environment but also enhanced the overall reliability of our data pipeline. 
It was all about keeping everyone on the same page. I made sure to keep the client looped in with regular updates - kind of like translating tech-speak into everyday language. And when things got really technical, I wasn't shy about pulling in some extra brainpower. We had a great team at BDO, and reaching out to Microsoft's support team was a game-changer, too. It's amazing how much you can achieve when you combine a bit of teamwork with open and honest communication.

## Why do you want to leave your job?
Firstly, I greatly value the experiences I've had in my current role, and I've learned a lot from the challenges presented.
	
The allocated project budget does not match the amount of work it requires to deliver a satisfying solution. This comes from the underestimation of the workload needed for developing full-scale ML solutions and it has really taken a tole on my work-life balance. 
Moreover, due to the short project timelines, our solutions tend to focus on the short term. However Managing the performance of ML pipelines and and data drift is a long-term progress it is just simply not feasible in the current setting. While I appreciate opportunities for growth, the rapid pace without adequate time for skill acquisition has been challenging.

I ready for a fresh challenge.

## What is your biggest achievement?
My greatest achievement was in my previous role where I built a prototype pipeline that automatically gather data and train model in iterative fashion. It was achieved by packaging python code inside various docker containers, plugging the containers into AWS Sagemaker tasks, and orchestrating different components by using AWS step function. This frees up machine learning team from day-to-day cumbersome work, which takes the majority of their time, and to work on more advanced research-oriented work without loosing visibility and control of the model training process. And the result of this is improved team productivity and level of skill set across the whole machine learning team.

## How do you deal with a conflict with a coworker?
I value diversity and understand that different people have different opinions, which may lead to conflict. When that happens, I would check if I was doing anything to contribute to the conflict before speaking to my co worker. After that I will talk to my co-worker in private to find an amicable way forward that we were both comfortable with. I would always put the needs of my team first and try to overcome the conflict so we could quickly move forward. I like to ask questions and understand their perspectives. This helps keep the situation calm, helps them feel like they’re being heard, and after this, I’ve found it’s much easier to come to an agreement or compromise while both staying a lot calmer. I will try to not get defensive when trying to express my opinion by actively practicing tactics to manage this behavior, such as pausing to take a deep breath and carefully considering my words before responding.

## Where do you see yourself in five years?
I love learning about new technologies and trends, so in the next five years, I see myself being a T-shaped data scientist. The “T” represents wide range of skills, across the top, with depth in one area represented by the vertical bar of the 'T'. Data science is such a collaborative and creative field, T-shaped data scientist can more easily work in interdisciplinary teams than those with less breadth and can be more effective than those without depth. I think a successful senior data scientist will be knowledgeable in database, math, statistics, optimization, cloud computing, pipeline development, and have good business sense and good communication skill. At the same time, they must also have a substantial, deep expertise in at least one of those field. For me that's math and model training. 
	
By working as a data scientist at Altoida, I will have gained interdisciplinary experience I mentione nd above by learning and collaborating with a cross-functional team that you have, and I’ll have stayed on top of new technologies by becoming active in one or more online machine learning communities. The result of all the hard work above will set me on a fast track to becoming a senior data scientist or even lead data scientist that oversees multiple machine learning projects. That’s my ultimate career goal that I hope to achieve at Altoida.

## Tell me about a time when you failed.
I was given this task to analyze the model performance and figure out a way to improve the model accuracy to at least 90%, and I was so eager to impress my manager that I told her I could finish the project within a week. I thought this was doable, but it ended up taking three weeks and she were not happy because she planed the rest of the sprint contingent upon me bringing the model up to a good performance. Looking back, I realized I should have been more conservative in my estimation. I realized that whoever you report to, could be your manager or a client, isn’t going to be upset if you’re clear about the timeline in advance, but they are going to be disappointed if you promise something and then don’t deliver. So I took this experience and used it to become much better at managing the expectations during projects I was given. For example, on the next project with a different objective, I told my manager it’d take four weeks and made her fully aware of the potential road block along the way and I finished in three instead of four. She was very happy about this.

## Tell me how you would handle a difficult situation?

**Situation:** While leading a significant project at BDO Digital for the Cooperative of American Physicians, a top client, we faced the challenge of overhauling their medical insurance underwriting process with AI. The client wanted to use their on-premise member data for the analysis, which conflicted with our recommendation of using a cloud-based SQL server for storage.

**Task:** My task was to find a solution that would allow us to use the client's on-premise data while still providing an online endpoint for the AI model to assess physician information and generate scores.

**Action:** After attempting various technical solutions to connect to the on-premise database from Azure, all of which failed, I escalated the issue to my manager, who then sought help from Microsoft's official dev support team. Concurrently, I thought of an alternative approach. I collaborated with the automation team, who could securely connect to the on-premise database outside of Azure. I transferred the feature engineering and cleaning logic into SQL so it could be incorporated during their query process. The automation team would then ingest the pre-processed data into an Azure SQL database accessible by our model's online endpoint.

**Result:** This solution bypassed the need to establish a direct connection from the online endpoint to the on-premise database, which Microsoft's support team eventually confirmed was not possible. This challenge taught me a super valuable lessons in handling project difficulties effectively, which is when there is a problem, making sure everyone was aware of it and don't linger on chasing a deadend. Quickly escalating the issue to experts so I can explore all possible solutions in parallel without delay. And on top of that, quick thinking on my feet about alternative solutions and communicate request to other team member in a diplomatic way so they understand the extra work all contributed to the success of resolving this issue quickly. 

### Alternative answer: 

In my previous position as a data scientist, I was tasked of developing the second half of the pipeline while my colleague was given the first half. So we split up our work load and assisted each other when necessary. After merging our results, I noticed since the first half weren't working correctly, on which my half of the development is dependent on. This leaves me with the responsibility of having to do extra error handling because the data that has been passed onto my part of the workflow is faulty, which will make me pass the delivery deadline.

Instead of involving our supervisor, I talked to her directly. I first made sure that she felt like her hard work did not go un-credited. What she's done is extremely pioneering and challenging but despite all that she still managed to have a running first part of the pipeline and that's an incredible accomplishment in itself. After that I told her I have also noticed some of the pipeline error can be traced back to her work and ultimately became my responsibility. I also explained if this was left unfixed, the entire project would suffer. What I offered is for us to fix the faulty part of the pipeline together to maximize the efficiency. After this conversation, my partner apologized and we worked super efficiently toward the same goal by supporting each other along the way and We finished well within the delivery deadline. I learned that working out issues among coworkers instead of involving supervisors can be very effective.

## Tell me about a time in which your colleagues weren’t convinced by your approach you believed strongly in. How did you change your approach to influence them?
In a previous data science role, the company had been using ResidualNet 50 as the model backbone for training image classification model. Although it is the state-of-the-art model structure to use on any image classification problem, it is an inherently complex model structure that takes a lot of computational resource when running inferences--so it's very expensive!  I suggested that we use a much compact model backbone called MobileNet, which is a reduced-sized model architecture that has been widely used in cell phone application and self-driving system due to it's light-weight, low-latency nature. At first, the team wasn’t open to testing a new approach because lighter weight models tends to have lower accuracy score. However, I created a small comparison test where I train two simple models using exact same data and hyper parameters, with their only difference being one is MobileNet backbone and the other is our old Residual Net 50 model backbone. The lighter-weight MobileNet model was running 10 times faster on CPU on the same batch of testing data than ResNet50 without compromising much on model accuracy. I created a short presentation on this result during our next weekly stand-up session and the team was very impress by the performance of this new model architecture. We have been switching to this new approach ever since.

## Tell me about a time when you disagreed with the direction of a project. What did you do?
One time, I disagreed with my manager over the process for building a pipeline, as their approach was to jump straight into the execution. I knew that it would be better to perform some planning in advance, rather than feeling our way through and reacting to roadblocks as they arose, so I documented a plan that could potentially save us time in development. That documentation and planning showed where pitfalls were likely to arise, and by solving for future issues we were able to launch the new pipeline a couple of weeks early.

## What is your biggest weakness?
My biggest weakness is that I don't yet have any leadership experience. I have not had the opportunity to lead tasks or projects yet, but this is something I am eager to do when the opportunity arises. I am the type of person who is always willing to learn, so if you see anything about my performance in this role that I could improve on, just let me know and I will take the appropriate steps to develop in that area.
 can independently lead and handle the challenge.

## What is your biggest strength?
My DISCIPLINE and dependability is a strength because it means I will always organize my work diligently. I will take ownership of important tasks and project and you can always count on me to make the decision that is in company's best interest. For instance in my last role I was able to detect duplications in image processing that costs us a lot and developed a methodology to run prediction on each image only once. Another of my strengths include my CREATIVITY. For example, in my last role I recommended to my manager that we should try using a lighter weight model structure to cut cost on cloud computing resources. Because a lighter weight model runs so much faster, it actually saved us a lot of money without compromising much on model accuracy. 
 
I am naturally a POSITIVE & ENTHUSIASTIC person, and this tends to rub off on other people in a team. Finally, I am a LOYAL & DEDICATED person. If I got hired, I will represent OpenZeppeline in a positive way, I am committed to LIFELONG LEARNING, which means I will always be a productive and high-performing member of your team and you will always be able to trust me with important duties and responsibilities.

## How would other people describe you?
My friends and previous co-workers have often described me as someone who is driven, enthusiastic and upbeat. I believe they would also describe me as someone they could turn to whenever they needed assistance; someone they could rely on to help them out at short notice, and someone who has a can-do attitude and that takes ownership of difficult situation.

## Why do you want this job?
I want this job because my research tells me you have a great company culture and working environment, and you support your staff to be the best versions of themselves possible. I feel I can make a big difference to the team in the role, and I will be able to add value to your company. 
 
And also, because it is the type of role that I genuinely love doing. It is very technical and I love to be intellectually challenged. I love feeling smarter at the end of the day than when I step into the job this morning. We spend a lot of time at work, and I want that time to be put to good use. I feel I already have the skills and qualities to match the job description which means I can come into the job hit-the-ground-running and start making positive impacts immediately. 
 
I love the wide range of skill sets I get to develop in this position and my last job took me away from that. This role will give me the opportunity to combine both my skills in model training and pipeline development experience to achieve the full life cycle of implementing machine learning in business. So now, I’m looking to find a role that will let me get back to working on projects I really enjoy and after looking at the job spec I think this role would be perfect with that. Because of my high energy levels I am CONFIDENT I can quickly learn what is required in the position and contribute to the team's objectives.

## What can you do for us
I can bring a diverse set of skills, qualities and experience to the team that I believe will help your business grow. I am a strong communicator, and I will always try to solve problems without troubling my manager. I can also bring a level of knowledge to this role that I believe is unrivaled because I come from the combination of a strong academic background from Georgetown University and a 3-years concentrated hands-on machine learning work experience. The previous equipped me with the theories behind machine learning and data science, while the latter put those schooling to real world's test where the unexpected happens all the time. My level of knowledge in ML and data science, along with my ability to work well under pressure will aid me in this role and help ensure positive return on your investment by hiring me.

## Tell me about a time when your role in a project was unclear. How did you resolve the issue.
When I first joined EagleView as a data scientist, the ML t eam was a start-up that just got acquired by the company so the role wasn’t clearly defined. The manager empowered me to define the objectives of the role by myself sometimes. Because the day-to-day responsibilities weren’t yet assigned, I knew it would be best to align my work to the company’s core objectives, which were to prototype a wide range of models, improve the quality of current testing data, and mine internet data available for our areas of interest. I developed a plan with milestones to make incremental quarterly progress towards those goals using data science techniques and communicated the objectives to my manager for feedback and approval. My manager agreed that the work and role was aligned with company objectives and continued to give me new leeway in tackling emerging issues and tasks.

## Tell me about a time you had to communicate something technical to a non-technical stakeholder
In a previous job, I was asked to demo the image preprocessing technique for one of the image classification models. I created a presentation that walks the management team through a serious of steps using visualizations tools and large amount of images as examples. I was able to design a flow chart as a visual aid to showcase how I was able to filter out low quality imageries step by step. I started from the raw input data, moving onto simple filtering techniques like using sizes and pixel values, and slowly built up to more advanced ones like Fourier transform to map building geometry coordinates to their image pixels. I took special attention so that the style of my narration resembles story-telling to make it engaging and avoided technical jargons as much as possible. Finally I wrapped up the presentation with a line chart to demonstrate the business impact by comparing model performance from before and after the pre-processing.

## Tell me about a time you used data to influence a decision or solve a problem.
Insurance companies like all-state are the primary clients at my previous company, EagleView. They wants to know about in which states more people tend to have pool in their backyard because a pool is considered an “attractive nuisance” and will increase the liability risk for pool accident. So they hired us to determine pool coverage across the US since we have aerial imagery coverage of residential property. 
	
So the project objective is to build a pool finder model and generate property reports for state-wise pool coverage to help all-states on their marketing champaign. 
	
I built a pool finder model that automatically detect whether there is a pool in people's backyard. Our baseline system was a binary image classification CNN model with two classes, pool or no pool and it worked. I started from a prototype model trained with a couple hundred of images and iteratively tune the model and added more training images so that the model was able to accurately detect 95% of the pool. After a couple of weeks, we have state-wise pool coverage report across all US so all-state can use it to allocate their Champaign resources.

## How comfortable are you presenting your insights?
I am mostly comfortable with it. But in large group settings it’s more difficult. For me, preparation is critical. First, I gather information about the audience and what their goals are. Then, I develop slides and a loose speaking script for the presentation. Lastly, I like to run through the presentation with manager or colleagues once or twice for clarity and relevance.

## Tell me about a time when you had to clean and organize a large dataset.
- **Situation:**  At my previous job, I was tasked with cleaning and organizing a large dataset of images that were crucial for training a machine learning model. The dataset consisted of historic metadata that I initially attempted to gather using Postgres SQL on a local machine.
- **Task:**  My objective was to ensure the dataset was of high quality and free of any biases or inaccuracies that could affect the model's performance. This involved pre-processing and filtering tasks, such as removing small images and black pixels, as well as images that were not relevant to our project, like houses in Florida.
- **Action:**  After realizing that the local environment was insufficient due to the size of the dataset, I migrated the process to AWS, utilizing Athena for more efficient querying within the AWS ecosystem. To handle the data on a local level, I sampled a small, unbiased batch and used tools like CyberDuck for visualization. Upon identifying low-quality and inaccurate data, I started a GPU remote machine with an attached larger volume disk to download and process all the images. I also implemented an auto-stopping mechanism to shut down the GPU after training to optimize resource usage.
- **Result:**  The next morning, I checked the results and found that the dataset was well-prepared, and the machine learning model training had gone well, thanks to the organized and clean data. This preparation played a significant role in the success of the model's performance.
