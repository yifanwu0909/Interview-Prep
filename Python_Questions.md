## OOP - Python
In Python, everything is an object, including numbers, strings, functions, and classes. This means that each entity in Python has attributes and methods associated with it, which define its properties and behaviors.

## Copy an object in Python
### Shallow Copy
A shallow copy creates a new object, but instead of copying the objects that the original object references, it only copies the references to those objects. Therefore, changes to mutable objects within the copied object would reflect in the original object as well.
```python
shallow_copied_list = copy.copy(original_list)
copied_list = original_list[:]
copied_dict = original_dict.copy()
```
### Deep Copy
A deep copy creates a new object and recursively copies all the objects it references. Changes to any level of nested objects within the copied object will not affect the original object.
```python
deep_copied_list = copy.deepcopy(original_list)
```

## Mutable vs Immutable  
**Mutable types** are those that allow for the modification of their content without changing their identity (memory address):     
- Lists    
- Dictionaries    
- Sets
           
**Immutable types** do not allow their content to be changed after they are created. If you try to change an immutable object, a new object is created instead. 
- Integers
- Floats
- Strings
- Tuples

## What are decorators in python
decorators wrap a function, modifying its behavior.   
To define a decorator, you typically define a function returning a wrapper function. The wrapper function uses *args and **kwargs to pass on arguments to the decorated function. If you want your decorator to also take arguments, you need to nest the wrapper function inside another function. In this case, you usually end up with three return statements. Decorators provide a simple syntax for calling higher-order functions. By definition, a decorator is a function that takes another function and extends the behavior of the latter function without explicitly modifying it. You'll use a decorator when you need to change the behavior of a function without modifying the function itself. A few good examples are when you want to add logging, test performance, perform caching, verify permissions, and so on. You can also use one when you need to run the same code on multiple functions.
```python
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        func()
        print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
    return wrapper

def say_whee():
    print("Whee!")

say_whee = my_decorator(say_whee)

>>> say_whee()
Something is happening before the function is called.
Whee!
Something is happening after the function is called.
```

## Why interpreter languages are slow
Interpreting code is slower than running the compiled code because the interpreter must analyze each statement in the program each time it is executed and then perform the desired action, whereas the compiled code just performs the action within a fixed context determined by the compilation. This run-time analysis is known as "interpretive overhead". Having to reprocess a line every time in a loop is what makes interpreted languages so slow. This overhead means that interpreted code runs between 5 - 10 times slower than compiled code.  Access to variables is also slower in an interpreter because the mapping of identifiers to storage locations must be done repeatedly at run-time rather than at compile time. 

Think of it this way. If you can talk in your native language to someone, that would generally work faster than having an interpreter having to translate your language into some other language for the listener to understand. 

The bottom line is that all computers really "understand" is binary instructions, which is what "fast" languages like C are compiled into.

## What is List comprehension
List comprehension offers a shorter syntax when you want to create a new list based on the values of an existing list.  

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "kiwi", "mango"]
newlist = []
for x in fruits:
  if "a" in x:
         newlist.append(x)

#VS:

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "kiwi", "mango"]
newlist = [x for x in fruits if "a" in x]
```

## Tuple VS a list
| Aspects \ Objects                                          | List                                               | Tuple                                              |

| Memory Consumption                                         | Lists consume more memory                          | Tuple consumes less memory as compared to the list |
| Built-in Methods                                           | Lists have several built-in methods                | Tuple does not have many built-in methods.         |
| Likelihood of Unexpected Changes and Errors                | The unexpected changes and errors are more likely to occur | In tuple, it is hard to take place.                 |

**Detail:**

Non interpreted means that itâ€™s already in machine code. To run each instruction all you have to do is load it. So the pattern looks like

- load next instruction.
- execute instruction.
- advance to next instruction.
This is all done in hardware. This is what processors do.

The interpreter model lifts some responsibility to software. The interpreted model looks like this (bear in mind the the interpreter itself is usually compiled and running under the above model)

- read next line
  - this itself is many instructions (perhaps hundreds) from the interpreter
- interpret meaning of line
  - scan line for errors and parse line for meaning (perhaps hundreds or thousands of instructions in the interpreter)
- execute line
  - effectively performing an instruction at the machine level, however as this is at a higher level this is likely several instructions
If you think about the interpreter model every line has to be interpreted for meaning before execution. Even If we assume this step to be as cheap as possible (1 instruction) the interpreter model has to be 2x slower than machine code. But the interpretation step can involve 100â€™s of additional instructions. Thus an interpreted program is going to be orders of magnitude slower.

## What does the generator function do in Python?
A special type of function that returns an iterator object. Instead of returning a single value, a generator yields a sequence of results, producing one item at a time and only when required. This is achieved using the `yield` statement instead of `return`. 

Here's what makes generator functions powerful:

1. **Lazy Evaluation**: Generator functions compute values on the fly and do not store the entire sequence in memory. This makes them highly efficient for working with large datasets or infinite sequences, as they only produce items when needed.

2. **Memory Efficiency**: Since the values are generated on demand and not stored, generator functions are memory efficient, especially when dealing with large data streams.

3. **Simplicity**: Generators can simplify code that would otherwise require complex iterators or recursive functions.

Here is a simple example of a generator function:

```python
def count_up_to(max):
    count = 1
    while count <= max:
        yield count
        count += 1

# Using the generator
for number in count_up_to(5):
    print(number)
```

In this example, `count_up_to` is a generator function that yields numbers from 1 up to a specified `max`. When used in a for loop, it generates numbers one by one; after yielding a number, it pauses its state until the next number is requested.

Key points to remember about generator functions:
- They use `yield` instead of `return`.
- Execution is paused and resumed on each `yield`, maintaining state between yields.
- They are more memory efficient for large datasets or streams.

## Explain the map function.
The `map()` function iterates over the items of the given iterable(s) and applies the function to each item. It returns a map object (an iterator), which can be easily converted into a list, tuple, etc., using the respective type constructors (`list()`, `tuple()`, etc.).
The function must take as many arguments as there are iterables.
This is a convenient way to perform element-wise transformations and operations on data structures.


### Key Points
- `map()` is useful for applying a function to each element in an iterable.
- It returns a map object, which is an iterator.
- For multiple iterables, the function is applied in a parallel fashion.
- The result can be converted to a list or other iterable types for further use or inspection.

## Explain what init py does
 _init_.py is a file in Python that data scientists use to mark directories as Python packages. It signals to the Python interpreter that a directory contains code for modules and ensures that Python treats directories as modules.
The `__init__.py` file is used in Python to mark directories on disk as Python package directories. If you have a directory containing Python script files and you want to be able to import those modules into other scripts, you need to create an empty file named `__init__.py` in that directory. This file can be empty, or it can contain valid Python code.

Here are the key points about `__init__.py`:

1. **Package Initialization**: The primary purpose of the `__init__.py` file is to initialize Python packages. The presence of `__init__.py` in a directory tells Python to treat the directory as a package, which means you can import modules from that directory into your scripts.

2. **Namespace Management**: `__init__.py` can also be used to define a controlled package namespace. You can use it to selectively import or define symbols (functions, classes, variables, etc.) so that they become accessible directly from the package. For example, if your package `mypackage` has a module `mymodule`, you can import `mymodule` or specific attributes from it into the `__init__.py` file, allowing users to access them directly from `mypackage` without having to import `mymodule` explicitly.

3. **Simplifying Imports**: By using `__init__.py`, you can make your package's interface cleaner and more accessible to users. For instance, instead of having users import functions from deeply nested modules, you can import these functions into `__init__.py`, allowing users to import them directly from the package.

In summary, the `__init__.py` file serves several important functions in Python packages, including package initialization, namespace management, and making packages easier to use and import from. Despite the changes in Python 3.3 and later, `__init__.py` remains a useful and commonly used feature of Python packages.
Help with module importation from various parts of the code. This helps in the finance industry, when data scientists need to organize financial models, and in healthcare, when organizing medical records.

## Reduce function
The `reduce` function in Python is part of the `functools` module and is used to apply a particular function passed in its argument to all of the list elements mentioned in the sequence passed along. This function is defined in the `functools` module, and we need to import it using `from functools import reduce` if we want to use it.

The `reduce` function, in essence, reduces a list or sequence into a single value by applying a binary function cumulatively to the items of the sequence, from left to right.

### Syntax
```python
reduce(function, iterable[, initializer])
```

- `function`: This is a function that takes two arguments and returns a single value. The function is applied to the items in the iterable.
- `iterable`: This is the sequence of items to reduce.
- `initializer`: (Optional) This is a value that is used as the initial value to start the reduction. If the initializer is provided, it is placed before the items of the sequence in the calculation, and serves as a default when the iterable is empty. If not provided, the first item in the iterable will be used as the initial value.

### How It Works
The `reduce` function takes the first two elements A and B in the iterable and applies the function to them to get the result, which we can call C. Then it takes C and applies the function to it and the next element in the iterable, and this process continues until there are no more elements left, resulting in a single cumulative value.

### Example
Here's an example of how to use `reduce` to calculate the factorial of a number:

```python
from functools import reduce

def multiply(x, y):
    return x * y

# Calculate the factorial of 5
numbers = range(1, 6)  # This will generate a sequence of numbers from 1 to 5
factorial = reduce(multiply, numbers)

print(factorial)
```

Output:
```
120
```

In this example, `reduce` applies the `multiply` function to the first two elements of the `numbers` sequence (1 and 2), resulting in 2. Then it applies `multiply` to the result (2) and the next element (3), resulting in 6, and so on until it processes the last element, resulting in the factorial of 5.

### Key Points
- `reduce` is not a built-in function; it needs to be imported from the `functools` module.
- It applies a function of two arguments cumulatively to the items of an iterable.
- It reduces the iterable to a single cumulative value.
- An optional initializer can be provided.
- Can be used with any function that takes two arguments and returns a single value. This makes it incredibly versatile and suitable for a wide range of tasks, including but not limited to concatenating strings, merging data structures, or computing custom aggregations.
- Simplifies Code
- More efficient than equivalent code written with explicit loops, especially with functions that are optimized for fast execution.

## filter function

`filter()` calls the provided function for each item in the iterable, and only includes the item in the result if the function returns `True`. The result is a `filter` object, which is an iterator that lazily produces the filtered values as you loop over them. This means that the entire list is not generated in memory at once, but rather element-by-element as you iterate.

### Advantages of Using `filter`

1. **Readability**: `filter` makes the code cleaner and more readable by abstracting away the mechanics of looping and conditionally adding items to a new list.

2. **Efficiency**: The returned `filter` object is an iterator, which means that it does not produce the list of results all at once. This can save memory and potentially increase performance for large datasets.

3. **Functional Programming Style**: `filter` encourages a functional programming style, leading to more declarative code that specifies what you want to achieve rather than how to achieve it.

4. **Versatility**: It can be used with any iterable, not just lists, making it a versatile tool for filtering data.

5. **Composability**: Functions like `filter` can be combined with other functional programming tools like `map` and `reduce` to perform complex data transformations and aggregations in a concise manner.

## Could you explain whether all memory gets freed when Python exits?

When Python exits, whether all memory gets freed depends on the environment and how Python is being run. In general, modern operating systems (like Windows, macOS, and Linux) are very good at reclaiming memory allocated by programs once they terminate. Here's a more detailed breakdown:

### Memory Managed by Python

Python uses a garbage collector to manage memory automatically. This means that during the execution of a Python program, the garbage collector will periodically look for Python objects that are no longer in use and reclaim their memory. However, this is during the lifetime of the program.

### At Python Exit

When a Python program exits, the Python runtime environment will attempt to clean up by:

1. **Closing open resources**: This includes file handles, network connections, and database connections. Python tries to close these properly to avoid data corruption or leaks.

2. **Garbage collection**: Python will perform a final pass of garbage collection to clean up Python objects.

3. **Freeing memory**: Memory that was allocated to Python objects is marked for release back to the operating system.

### Operating System's Role

Once the Python process terminates, the operating system takes over. Modern operating systems are designed to reclaim all resources allocated to a process once it ends. This includes memory, file handles, and other resources. So, from the perspective of the operating system, all memory allocated to the Python process should be freed upon its termination.

### Caveats

- **Memory Leaks**: If the Python program interfaces with external libraries (especially C libraries) through extensions or FFI (Foreign Function Interface), and those libraries allocate memory, it's up to those libraries to properly manage that memory. If they don't, there could be memory leaks. However, when the process terminates, the operating system should still reclaim this memory.
  
- **Subprocesses**: If your Python program spawns subprocesses and doesn't wait for them to terminate, those subprocesses might continue running beyond the lifetime of the parent Python process. Memory used by these subprocesses would not be freed when the Python process exits.

- **Embedded Python**: If Python is embedded in another application, the memory management might depend more on the host application's behavior rather than Python's own memory management mechanisms.

### Conclusion

In most cases and environments, you can expect that all memory allocated to a Python process will be freed upon its exit, thanks to the combination of Python's own cleanup efforts and the operating system's management of process resources. However, specific scenarios involving external libraries, subprocesses, or embedded Python might require additional consideration.

## Can you explain what pass means in Python?
In Python, the `pass` statement is a null operation; it does nothing when executed. It is used as a placeholder in parts of your code where a statement is syntactically required, but you do not want any command or code to execute. 

### Usage of `pass`

1. **Empty Control Flow Blocks**: In Python, control flow statements like `if`, `for`, `while`, etc., require at least one statement inside their block. If you have not decided what code to put yet or simply do not need to execute anything, you can use `pass` as a placeholder.

   ```python
   if condition:
       pass  # TODO: add logic later
   ```

2. **Empty Functions or Methods**: Similarly, when defining a function or method that you intend to implement later, `pass` can be used to avoid a syntax error and serve as a reminder.

   ```python
   def function_that_does_nothing_yet():
       pass
   ```

3. **Minimal Classes**: In object-oriented programming, you might want to define a class with no methods or attributes initially. `pass` allows you to do so without syntax errors.

   ```python
   class MyEmptyClass:
       pass
   ```

### Example

Here's a practical example demonstrating the use of `pass`:

```python
for number in range(5):
    if number == 2:
        pass  # Normally, you might handle this condition differently
    else:
        print(number)
```

Output:
```
0
1
3
4
```

In this example, when `number` is 2, the `pass` statement does nothing, and the loop continues without interrupting the flow or printing the number 2.

### Key Points

- The `pass` statement is a no-operation action that is syntactically necessary.
- It is useful as a placeholder in blocks where code will be added later.
- `pass` can be used to define minimal structures without causing syntax errors.
- Unlike comments, the `pass` statement is recognized and executed by the Python interpreter, but it results in no operation.

## How would you store the first and last names of candidates in Python?

The choice of data structure depends on how you plan to use the data:

- If you need to access the first and last names separately and frequently, using a tuple, dictionary, or a class might be more convenient.
- If you need to maintain the order of insertion and ensure that each candidate is unique, a list is appropriate.
- If you need to perform more complex operations on the candidate data, such as sorting or filtering based on attributes, a class or named tuple might be the best choice.
- If you just need to store and display the names without further manipulation, a list of strings could suffice.

Each method has its own advantages and is suitable for different scenarios. Consider the specific needs of your application when deciding which method to use.

## Please explain what monkey patching means in Python.

Monkey patching is a term used in programming to describe the dynamic (or runtime) modifications of a class or module. In Python, this means altering or extending the behavior of libraries, modules, classes, or methods during runtime, without modifying the source code. Monkey patching can be powerful but should be used with caution, as it can lead to code that is hard to understand and maintain.

### How Monkey Patching Works in Python

In Python, functions and methods are first-class objects, meaning they can be passed around and manipulated just like any other object. This feature allows Python programmers to change the behavior of code at runtime.

For example, consider a module `math_ops` with a function `add` that simply adds two numbers. If you wanted to change the behavior of `add` to, say, always subtract instead of adding, you could do so using monkey patching.

```python
# math_ops.py
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```

```python
import math_ops

# Original behavior
print(math_ops.add(2, 3))  # Output: 5

# Monkey patching the add function
def subtract(a, b):
    return a - b

math_ops.add = subtract

# Modified behavior
print(math_ops.add(2, 3))  # Output: -1
```

### Advantages of Monkey Patching

- **Flexibility**: Monkey patching allows you to modify or extend the behavior of libraries or classes without altering their source code. This can be particularly useful when working with third-party code.
- **Testing**: It can be used in testing to mock or stub out methods with side effects or external dependencies, making it easier to test components in isolation.

### Disadvantages and Risks

- **Maintenance Challenges**: Code that relies on monkey patching can be difficult to understand and maintain, especially for someone who isn't aware of the runtime modifications.
- **Compatibility Issues**: If the library or module you've monkey patched changes its implementation or interface, your code might break, leading to compatibility issues.
- **Debugging Difficulty**: Debugging issues related to monkey patched code can be challenging, as the behavior of the code does not match what's written in the source files.

### Best Practices

Given the risks associated with monkey patching, it's generally recommended to use it sparingly and carefully. Here are some best practices:

- **Documentation**: Clearly document any monkey patches you apply, including the rationale behind them.
- **Isolation**: Keep monkey patches isolated from the core logic of your application to minimize dependencies on modified behavior.
- **Testing**: Ensure thorough testing of monkey patched code to catch any unintended consequences early.
- **Alternatives**: Whenever possible, consider alternatives to monkey patching, such as subclassing, decorators, or contributing patches to the upstream project.

In summary, while monkey patching is a powerful tool in Python, it should be used judiciously and with an understanding of the potential implications for code maintainability and stability.

## Pylint

Pylint is a package. Pylint analyzes Python code without actually executing it to detect various types of errors, such as syntax errors, logical errors, and stylistic errors. It also provides suggestions for code improvements, helping developers adhere to best practices and coding standards, such as those outlined in PEP 8, the official Python style guide.

### Key Features of Pylint

- **Error Detection**: Pylint can identify coding errors that could lead to bugs in the program, such as syntax errors, type errors (when type checking is enabled), and undefined variables.
- **Code Quality Scores**: It assigns a numerical score to your code based on its analysis, encouraging developers to improve their code quality iteratively.
- **Refactoring Suggestions**: Beyond finding errors, Pylint suggests places where the code could be refactored to improve readability, simplicity, or performance.
- **Style Checking**: It enforces a consistent coding style across the project, which is crucial for maintainability, especially in projects with multiple contributors.
- **Customizable**: Pylint is highly configurable, allowing teams to define their own set of rules on top of the default set. You can enable or disable specific checks according to your project's needs.
- **Integration**: It can be integrated into development environments, continuous integration pipelines, and editors, providing feedback to developers in real-time or as part of the development workflow.

### How to Use Pylint

To use Pylint, you first need to install it, typically via pip:

```sh
pip install pylint
```

Once installed, you can run Pylint on a Python file or module to analyze it:

```sh
pylint my_module.py
```

Pylint will print out a report detailing any warnings or errors found in the code, along with a final score indicating the code quality.

### Example Output

Here's an example of what Pylint's output might look like:

```
************* Module my_module
my_module.py:1: [C0111(missing-docstring), ] Missing module docstring
my_module.py:1: [E0602(undefined-variable), ] Undefined variable 'nonexistent_var'

------------------------------------------------------------------
Your code has been rated at -10.00/10 (previous run: 10.00/10, -20.00)
```

This output indicates that the module `my_module.py` has a missing module docstring and uses an undefined variable, leading to a negative score. The goal is to address these issues to improve the score towards 10/10.

### Conclusion

Pylint is a powerful tool for maintaining high standards of code quality in Python projects. By integrating Pylint into the development process, teams can catch potential issues early, enforce coding standards, and ultimately produce cleaner, more maintainable code.

## Please explain how you would check if a Pandas data frame is empty.

The `empty` attribute is the most straightforward and idiomatic way to check for an empty DataFrame in Pandas. It is efficient because it does not require scanning the entire DataFrame; it simply checks the underlying array shapes.

```python
df.empty
```
Output:
```
True
```

## Is it possible for lambda forms to contain statements in Python?

Unlike regular functions defined with `def`, lambda functions cannot contain statements. Statements include things like `return`, `assert`, or `pass`, as well as assignments, loops, and `if` statements with bodies that contain multiple expressions.

However, it is possible to mimic certain statement-like behaviors within the single expression allowed in a lambda by using techniques such as conditional expressions.

### Conditional Expressions in Lambda

Conditional expressions (or ternary operators) can be used in lambda functions to simulate simple `if-else` statement logic. A conditional expression has the form `a if condition else b`, and it can be included in a lambda.

**Example:**

```python
# Using a conditional expression in a lambda function
is_even = lambda x: True if x % 2 == 0 else False

print(is_even(4))  # Output: True
print(is_even(5))  # Output: False
```

### Workarounds for Complex Logic

For more complex logic that would typically require statements, it's recommended to define a regular function using `def`. If you absolutely need to keep it in a lambda for some reason (which is generally not advised due to readability concerns), you might resort to using functions that encapsulate the desired behavior.

**Example: Using built-in functions in lambda:**

```python
# Using the 'map' function within a lambda to apply an operation to multiple items
apply_func = lambda func, values: list(map(func, values))

# Squaring numbers using the above lambda
squared_values = apply_func(lambda x: x**2, [1, 2, 3, 4])
print(squared_values)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16]
```

### Conclusion

While lambda functions in Python are limited to a single expression and cannot contain traditional statements, you can often use conditional expressions and other functional programming techniques to achieve the desired outcome. For more complex scenarios, defining a regular function with `def` is the clearer and more maintainable approach.

## Pickling

Converting a Python object into a byte stream to save it to a file or transmit it over a network. This byte stream can then be stored or sent and later be "unpickled" â€” that is, converted back into the original Python object. 

### How Pickling Works

To pickle an object, you use the `pickle.dump()` function, which writes the pickled byte stream to a file-like object. Alternatively, you can use `pickle.dumps()` to get a bytes object.

Here's an example of pickling a Python dictionary:

```python
import pickle
pickled_data = pickle.dumps(data)

# Save the pickled byte stream to a file
with open('data.pkl', 'wb') as file:
    file.write(pickled_data)
```

### How Unpickling Works

```python
import pickle

with open('data.pkl', 'rb') as file:
    pickled_data = file.read()

# Unpickle the byte stream to get the original Python object
data = pickle.loads(pickled_data)
print(data)  # Output: {'key': 'value', 'foo': 'bar'}
```

- **Efficiency**: Pickling can be an efficient way to serialize and deserialize Python objects, but it may not be the most space-efficient format compared to other serialization methods like JSON or Protocol Buffers, especially for simple data structures.

## enumerate

enumerate() is particularly useful when you need both the index and the value when looping through an iterable. Without enumerate(), you might use a loop with a manually incremented counter. Readable, convenient, and flexible: `enumerate(iterable, start=0)`
