## Bias & Variance Trade Off
### Definition
Of the changes you could make to most learning algorithms, there are some that reduce bias errors but at the cost of increasing variance, and vice versa.
### Bias
An error that occurs due to overly simplistic assumptions or erroneous assumptions in the learning algorithm. If you use bias, it can lead to the model underfitting your data with low predictive accuracy.
### Variance
An error due to complexity in the learning algorithm. In variance, your data gets highly sensitive to high degrees of variation, leading your model to overfit the data. You'll end up carrying noise from your training data for your model to be useful for your test data.

## Techniques for Reducing Variance
1. Add more data
2. Add penalties(L1 and L2)
3. Early stopping and drop out
4. Feature selection 
5. Decrease model size
6. Modify input features based on insights from error analysis
7. Modify model architecture
